# Ex4_OOP
This project aims to simulate graph traversal.
Each simulation plays for about 30 to 60 seconds, and for each simulation a constant amount of 'agents' can travel the graph and if they pass through an edge with certain 'pokemon' they absorb him, and the at the end, the amount of points earned is printed.

## Algorithm implementations
| Algorithm | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Graph database | With json from server, we construct a graph with the networkx library. |
| Algorithm | Using the networkx library, we calculate an approximation of the optimal route to help us capture as much pokemons as we can. |
| GUI | With pygame, and the code given to us, we improve upon the GUI by adding timer, setting 'q' as an exit button and displaying more useful information. |
