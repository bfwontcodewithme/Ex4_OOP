# Ex4_OOP
This project aims to simulate graph traversal.
Each simulation plays for about 30 to 60 seconds, and for each simulation a constant amount of 'agents' can travel the graph and if they pass through an edge with certain 'pokemon' they absorb him, and the at the end, the amount of points earned is printed.
